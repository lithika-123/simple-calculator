simple-calculator


This is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can handle simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The layout is clean and easy to use — all the buttons are arranged in a grid, and results are shown in real time as users interact with it.

The calculator includes:

* Number buttons (0–9)
* Operators (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`)
* A decimal point (`.`)
* A clear (`C`) button to reset the display
* An equals (`=`) button to calculate the result

The design focuses on simplicity and usability. It’s responsive enough to work on different screen sizes and provides a smooth experience without any unnecessary distractions. This project is a great example of how front-end technologies can be used together to create functional, interactive tools
